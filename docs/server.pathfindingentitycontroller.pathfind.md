## PathfindingEntityController.pathfind() method

Calculates a path and moves to the target if a path is found.

Use for: one-shot navigation to a destination. Do NOT use for: high-frequency replanning; it is synchronous.

**Signature:**

```typescript
pathfind(target: Vector3Like, speed: number, options?: PathfindingOptions): boolean;
```

**Returns:**

boolean

True if a path was found, false otherwise.

\*\*Requires:\*\* The controller must be attached to a spawned entity in a world.

\*\*Side effects:\*\* Starts movement and facing if a path is found.

\*\*Category:\*\* Controllers

## Remarks

\*\*Synchronous return:\*\* Path calculation happens synchronously. Returns `true` if a path was found, `false` if no path exists or calculation was aborted.

\*\*Auto-starts movement:\*\* If a path is found, movement begins immediately using the inherited `move()`<!-- -->, `face()`<!-- -->, and `jump()` methods from `SimpleEntityController`<!-- -->.

\*\*Auto-facing (-Z forward):\*\* Automatically calls `face()` for each waypoint, orienting the entity's -Z axis toward the next waypoint. Models must be authored with their front facing -Z.

\*\*A\* algorithm:\*\* Uses A\* pathfinding with configurable `maxJump`<!-- -->, `maxFall`<!-- -->, and `verticalPenalty`<!-- -->. Path calculation is capped by `maxOpenSetIterations` (default 200) to prevent blocking.

\*\*Waypoint progression:\*\* Entity moves through calculated waypoints sequentially. Each waypoint has a timeout (`waypointTimeoutMs`<!-- -->) after which it's skipped if not reached.
